Created this change system.

Currently thinking about some universal process system called Pipes.

The app is actually gonna be called pipelines.

It centers around the journal table and here's how I think we're gonna use it.

- Record create
  - who would be create:{table}.{app}:{id}
  - what would be create: model.export()
- Record update
  - who would be update:{table}.{app}:{id}
  - what would be only differing
    - before: values before update
    - after: values after update
- Record delete
  - who would be delete:{table}.{app}:{id}
  - what would be only differing
    - delete: values before deltet
- Query update
  - who would be update:{table}.{app}
  - what would be only differing
    - query: The query run
    - set: What was set
    - count: How many updated
- Query delete
  - who would be delete:{table}.{app}
  - what would be only differing
    - query: The query run
    - count: How many deleted
- And I don't think this can be the universal table at all we don't need that for this
